[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)#Gameplay)

The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers.

## Ship

1. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward.

>> DONE

2. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction.

>> DONE

3. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting.

>> DONE

4. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

>> Not sure if I'll add this to this version of the game..


## Asteroids

5. Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen.

>> PARTLY DONE:
>> - Need to introduce levels
>> - Need to randomize start positions

6. Objects wrap around screen edges â€“ for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction.

>> DONE

7. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit.

>> DONE

8. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points.

>> DONE

## Saucers

9. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the "big saucer" shoots randomly and poorly, while the "small saucer" fires frequently at the ship.

>> TODO

10. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears.

>> TODO

11. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately.

>> TODO

12. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level.

>> TODO

## Scoring

13. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000.

>> TODO

14. The player starts with 3 lives after a coin is inserted and gains an extra life every 10,000 points.

>> TODO

15. When the player loses all his lives, the game ends.

>> TODO
